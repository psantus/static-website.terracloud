# Event-Driven Architecture: Reconciling Notifications and Complete Events

Event-driven architecture has become a cornerstone of modern distributed systems. However, one of the key design decisions architects face is choosing between notification events and complete events. Each approach has its merits and trade-offs.

## Understanding Event Types

### Notification Events
Notification events are lightweight messages that signal that something has happened, but contain minimal information about what changed.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "eventType": "UserUpdated",
  "userId": "12345",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-15T14:30:00Z",
  "version": 2
}
```

### Complete Events (Fat Events)
Complete events contain all the information about what changed, including both the old and new state.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "eventType": "UserUpdated",
  "userId": "12345",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-15T14:30:00Z",
  "version": 2,
  "changes": {
    "email": {
      "old": "john@example.com",
      "new": "john.doe@example.com"
    },
    "profile": {
      "old": {"name": "John", "age": 30},
      "new": {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
    }
  }
}
```

## Notification Events: Pros and Cons

### Advantages

**Smaller Message Size:** Reduced network bandwidth and storage requirements.

**Loose Coupling:** Consumers decide what information they need and when to fetch it.

**Security:** Sensitive data isn't broadcast to all consumers.

**Flexibility:** Easy to add new consumers without changing the event structure.

### Disadvantages

**Additional API Calls:** Consumers must make separate calls to get details.

**Temporal Coupling:** The source system must be available when consumers need data.

**Complexity:** Handling cases where the entity no longer exists or has changed again.

**Performance Impact:** Multiple consumers making the same API calls.

## Complete Events: Pros and Cons

### Advantages

**Self-Contained:** All necessary information is in the event.

**No Additional Calls:** Consumers can process events without external dependencies.

**Historical Record:** Complete audit trail of what changed and when.

**Offline Processing:** Consumers can work even if source systems are unavailable.

### Disadvantages

**Larger Messages:** Increased bandwidth and storage requirements.

**Tight Coupling:** Event structure changes affect all consumers.

**Security Concerns:** All data is visible to all consumers.

**Duplication:** Same data might be sent to multiple consumers unnecessarily.

## Hybrid Approaches

### Enriched Notifications
Include commonly needed fields in notification events while keeping them lightweight.

```json
{
  "eventType": "UserUpdated",
  "userId": "12345",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-15T14:30:00Z",
  "version": 2,
  "changedFields": ["email", "profile.name"],
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Event Sourcing with Projections
Store complete events in an event store and provide different projections for different consumers.

### Claim Check Pattern
Store large payloads externally and include a reference in the event.

```json
{
  "eventType": "UserUpdated",
  "userId": "12345",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-15T14:30:00Z",
  "payloadLocation": "s3://events/user-updates/12345-v2.json"
}
```

## Choosing the Right Approach

### Use Notification Events When:

- **High Volume:** Processing millions of events per day
- **Security Sensitive:** Different consumers need different levels of access
- **Diverse Consumers:** Many different types of consumers with varying needs
- **Bandwidth Constrained:** Network or storage costs are a primary concern

### Use Complete Events When:

- **Audit Requirements:** Need complete historical record of changes
- **Offline Processing:** Consumers might process events asynchronously
- **Simple Architecture:** Want to minimize system complexity
- **Real-time Analytics:** Need immediate access to all changed data

## Implementation Patterns

### Event Store Design
```python
class EventStore:
    def append_event(self, stream_id, event_type, event_data, metadata=None):
        event = {
            'stream_id': stream_id,
            'event_type': event_type,
            'event_data': event_data,
            'metadata': metadata or {},
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow(),
            'version': self.get_next_version(stream_id)
        }
        self.store.append(event)
        self.publish_notification(event)
    
    def publish_notification(self, event):
        notification = {
            'event_type': event['event_type'],
            'stream_id': event['stream_id'],
            'version': event['version'],
            'timestamp': event['timestamp']
        }
        self.message_bus.publish(notification)
```

### Consumer Pattern for Notifications
```python
class NotificationConsumer:
    def handle_event(self, notification):
        if self.should_process(notification):
            # Fetch complete data if needed
            entity = self.api_client.get_entity(
                notification['stream_id'], 
                notification['version']
            )
            self.process_entity(entity)
    
    def should_process(self, notification):
        # Implement filtering logic
        return notification['event_type'] in self.interested_events
```

### Consumer Pattern for Complete Events
```python
class CompleteEventConsumer:
    def handle_event(self, complete_event):
        if self.should_process(complete_event):
            # All data is available in the event
            self.process_changes(complete_event['changes'])
            self.update_local_state(complete_event)
    
    def should_process(self, event):
        # Can filter based on actual changes
        return any(field in event['changes'] 
                  for field in self.monitored_fields)
```

## Best Practices

### Event Design
- **Immutable Events:** Never modify published events
- **Versioned Schemas:** Plan for schema evolution
- **Correlation IDs:** Include tracing information
- **Idempotency Keys:** Enable safe retries

### Consumer Design
- **Idempotent Processing:** Handle duplicate events gracefully
- **Error Handling:** Implement retry and dead letter patterns
- **Monitoring:** Track processing metrics and failures
- **Backpressure:** Handle high-volume scenarios

### Security Considerations
- **Event Encryption:** Protect sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Access Control:** Implement fine-grained permissions
- **Audit Logging:** Track who accessed what events when
- **Data Retention:** Implement appropriate retention policies

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
- **Event Volume:** Track events per second/minute/hour
- **Processing Latency:** Time from event publication to processing
- **Error Rates:** Failed processing attempts
- **Consumer Lag:** How far behind consumers are

### Distributed Tracing
```python
import opentelemetry.trace as trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def publish_event(event_data):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("publish_event") as span:
        span.set_attribute("event.type", event_data['type'])
        span.set_attribute("event.stream_id", event_data['stream_id'])
        
        # Add correlation ID to event
        event_data['correlation_id'] = span.get_span_context().trace_id
        
        message_bus.publish(event_data)
```

## Conclusion

The choice between notification events and complete events isn't binary. The best approach depends on your specific requirements around performance, security, coupling, and complexity.

Consider starting with notification events for their flexibility and evolving to complete events or hybrid approaches as your understanding of consumer needs grows.

The key is to design your event architecture with evolution in mind, using versioning and abstraction layers that allow you to change approaches without breaking existing consumers.
