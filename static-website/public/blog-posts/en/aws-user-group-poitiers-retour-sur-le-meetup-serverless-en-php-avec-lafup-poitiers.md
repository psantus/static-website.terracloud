# AWS User Group Poitiers: Recap of the Serverless PHP Meetup with AFUP Poitiers

Last month, the AWS User Group Poitiers organized a joint meetup with AFUP Poitiers focused on serverless PHP development. Here's a recap of this successful event that brought together cloud and PHP enthusiasts.

## Event Overview

The meetup attracted over 50 developers, architects, and tech enthusiasts from the Poitiers region and beyond. The collaboration between AWS User Group Poitiers and AFUP (Association Fran√ßaise des Utilisateurs de PHP) created a unique opportunity to explore how traditional PHP development can embrace serverless architectures.

## Key Presentations

### "PHP in the Serverless Era" by Paul Santus

The opening presentation explored how PHP, traditionally associated with server-based architectures, can thrive in serverless environments:

- **Bref Framework:** Introduction to the leading PHP serverless framework
- **AWS Lambda Layers:** Optimizing PHP runtime for Lambda
- **Performance Considerations:** Cold starts, memory optimization, and execution time
- **Real-world Examples:** Case studies from production deployments

### "Building a Serverless PHP API with AWS Lambda" - Live Demo

A hands-on demonstration showing:

```php
<?php
// Simple Lambda handler using Bref
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Bref\Context\Context;
use Bref\Event\Http\HttpRequestEvent;
use Bref\Event\Http\HttpResponse;

return function (HttpRequestEvent $event, Context $context) {
    $method = $event->getMethod();
    $path = $event->getPath();
    
    // Simple routing
    if ($method === 'GET' && $path === '/users') {
        return new HttpResponse(
            json_encode(['users' => getUsersFromDynamoDB()]),
            ['Content-Type' => 'application/json']
        );
    }
    
    return new HttpResponse('Not Found', [], 404);
};

function getUsersFromDynamoDB() {
    $dynamodb = new Aws\DynamoDb\DynamoDbClient([
        'region' => 'eu-west-1',
        'version' => 'latest'
    ]);
    
    $result = $dynamodb->scan([
        'TableName' => 'Users'
    ]);
    
    return $result['Items'];
}
```

### "Serverless PHP: Performance and Cost Optimization"

This technical deep-dive covered:

- **Memory vs. CPU optimization** for PHP Lambda functions
- **Connection pooling** strategies for database access
- **Caching patterns** using ElastiCache and DynamoDB
- **Cost analysis** comparing traditional hosting vs. serverless

## Technical Highlights

### Bref Framework Deep Dive

The audience was particularly interested in Bref, the framework that makes PHP serverless possible:

```yaml
# serverless.yml configuration
service: php-serverless-api

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: provided.al2
  region: eu-west-1

plugins:
  - ./vendor/bref/bref

functions:
  api:
    handler: index.php
    layers:
      - ${bref:layer.php-81-fpm}
    events:
      - httpApi: '*'
  
  worker:
    handler: worker.php
    layers:
      - ${bref:layer.php-81}
    events:
      - sqs:
          arn: !GetAtt Queue.Arn
```

### Performance Benchmarks

Live performance comparisons showed:

- **Cold start times:** 200-500ms for PHP Lambda functions
- **Warm execution:** Sub-50ms response times
- **Memory efficiency:** Optimal performance at 512MB-1GB
- **Cost comparison:** 60-80% cost reduction for variable workloads

## Community Discussions

### Q&A Session Highlights

**Q: How does PHP serverless compare to Node.js or Python?**
A: While PHP has slightly higher cold start times, the ecosystem maturity and developer familiarity often outweigh the performance differences for many use cases.

**Q: What about existing PHP applications?**
A: Migration strategies vary from lift-and-shift approaches using containers to gradual refactoring using the Strangler Fig pattern.

**Q: Database connections in serverless PHP?**
A: Connection pooling is crucial. Solutions include RDS Proxy, connection pooling libraries, and designing for stateless operations.

### Networking and Knowledge Sharing

The event fostered valuable connections between:
- Traditional PHP developers curious about cloud adoption
- Cloud architects looking to support PHP workloads
- Startups considering serverless-first approaches
- Enterprise teams evaluating modernization strategies

## Practical Workshops

### Hands-on Lab: Deploy Your First PHP Lambda

Participants worked through a guided lab:

1. **Setup:** Installing Bref and Serverless Framework
2. **Development:** Creating a simple PHP API
3. **Deployment:** Deploying to AWS Lambda
4. **Testing:** Load testing and monitoring
5. **Optimization:** Performance tuning and cost optimization

### Code Examples Shared

```php
// Event-driven processing example
<?php
use Bref\Event\Sqs\SqsEvent;
use Bref\Event\Sqs\SqsHandler;

class EmailProcessor extends SqsHandler
{
    public function handleSqs(SqsEvent $event, Context $context): void
    {
        foreach ($event->getRecords() as $record) {
            $message = json_decode($record->getBody(), true);
            
            // Process email sending
            $this->sendEmail($message);
        }
    }
    
    private function sendEmail(array $message): void
    {
        $ses = new Aws\Ses\SesClient([
            'region' => 'eu-west-1',
            'version' => 'latest'
        ]);
        
        $ses->sendEmail([
            'Source' => $message['from'],
            'Destination' => ['ToAddresses' => [$message['to']]],
            'Message' => [
                'Subject' => ['Data' => $message['subject']],
                'Body' => ['Text' => ['Data' => $message['body']]]
            ]
        ]);
    }
}

return new EmailProcessor();
```
