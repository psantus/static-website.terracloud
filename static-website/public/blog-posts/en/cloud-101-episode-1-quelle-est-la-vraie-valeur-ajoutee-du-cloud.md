# Cloud 101 Episode 1: What is the Real Added Value of the Cloud?

Considering the use of Cloud services can be frightening for an organization. The step to take may seem high (and expensive) and some write long articles about how they decided to go back after having (foolishly) spent millions in hosting costs. However, far from being a money pit, the Cloud can be an important growth factor.

In my opinion, the **main benefit is the empowerment of tech teams and their alignment with business challenges**. This gain is not achieved magically by using the cloud, but it is a key technical lever that enables cultural and organizational transformation.

At [Alterna Ã©nergie](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alterna-energie/), the adoption of Cloud and agile development methods allowed dev teams to **deliver in very short timeframes** (MVP in 3 months, production deployment in less than 6 months) new B2C and B2B customer spaces, as well as a subscription funnel. Most importantly, the continuous integration (testing and delivery) logic put in place allows these teams to **evolve these applications on 2-week cycles while avoiding regressions**, which has been crucial in an environment that has experienced numerous crises over the past two years.

Relying on a fully managed infrastructure (serverless), teams are not caught up in incident management and can **dedicate their energy to being true business partners**. [ENERGY POOL](https://www.linkedin.com/company/energy-pool/) shares this experience: its development team achieves the feat of offering a **highly available and failure-resilient application**, providing services to the electrical grid 24/7, with a technical team working only during business hours.

The move to Cloud allowed them to **do without DBAs almost immediately, and in less than six months, without third-party managed services**. Beyond the cost of these services, the time returned to the team allows them to interact more frequently with their customers.

Moving 500 virtual machines to the Cloud does not in itself create customer orientation. However, the time saved from not having to anticipate equipment renewal, ordering, installation, managing failures, manually patching operating systems, learning to manage database clusters or middleware, etc. can be returned for the enterprise and its customers.

**Initially, the technical team regains mental availability to better listen to its internal and external customers; with maturity, it can also become capable of being a force for proposals!**

If your tech team hasn't yet proposed a solution deployable in 15 days to integrate ChatGPT and similar tools into your customer relationship management solution, thus gaining 40% productivity for your customer service center, then you can still gain added value through the cloud.

This is precisely the value proposition of [TerraCloud](https://www.linkedin.com/company/terracloud/): boost your IT teams and make them business partners through intelligent cloud adoption.
