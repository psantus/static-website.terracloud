# The shortest (and cheapest) way to achieving all 12 AWS certifications

After completing all 12 AWS certifications and earning my golden jacket, I want to share the most efficient and cost-effective path I discovered. This journey taught me valuable lessons about certification strategy, learning approaches, and smart ways to reduce costs without compromising on knowledge.

## Why getting certified?

Some people dismiss AWS certifications as useless pieces of paper. I strongly disagree, and here's why:

### Establishing credibility
I come from a functional and management background - even though I always had a technical mindset. When I started my independent consulting journey, certifications helped establish credibility in the early days. They provided tangible proof of my AWS knowledge to potential clients who didn't know my technical capabilities.

### Teaching opportunities as an AAI
As an AWS Authorized Instructor (AAI), the courses I can teach depend directly on my certifications. Each certification unlocks new teaching opportunities and expands my ability to help others learn AWS.

### The real benefit: learning opportunity
But here's the most important point - certifications are a fantastic learning opportunity. The structured approach forces you to explore AWS services systematically, understand their use cases, and learn best practices. This is the main benefit that makes the entire journey worthwhile.

## My certification journey

The path to all 12 certifications became much more affordable through strategic planning and understanding the certification ecosystem:

### The 50% voucher system
Every passed certification gives you a 50% voucher for the next one. This immediately cuts your costs in half for subsequent exams, making the journey much more economical.

### Community involvement benefits
Being active in the AWS community as a Community Builder and User Group Leader provided additional opportunities, including occasional certification vouchers. Community involvement also enhanced my learning through knowledge sharing and networking.

### Professional development
As a Champion AAI, certification exams became part of my professional development path. This alignment between career growth and certification goals made the journey more purposeful.

## My tips for your certification journey

### Skip expensive courses
Certifications don't require you to attend expensive online courses. If you have the right experience, the practice exams provided by AWS are often enough to pass.

### Invest in Skillbuilder
Get a Skillbuilder plan for a couple of months before your exams. You'll have access to more practice exams, which helps you get comfortable with the exam question style.

In architecting questions, remember that the "LEAST effort" solution may not be the same as the "LESS COSTLY" one. Each answer comes with detailed explanations about why it's right or wrong, plus links to the appropriate documentation. This is actually a great way to go through AWS documentation without having to read every service guide back to back.

### Essential reading
Read the Well Architected white papers, especially those on Disaster Recovery. These provide fundamental knowledge that appears across multiple certification exams.

### The "encryption rule"
If the question is about encryption, then the answer is always "KMS" :D. 

This is just one example - there are quite a few questions that can be answered in seconds if you have the right reflexes, allowing you to dedicate more time to the harder ones.

### Specialty exam requirements
Some specialty exams require domain-specific knowledge beyond AWS. For example:
- Advanced Networking requires BGP routing knowledge
- ML Specialty needs understanding of evaluation metrics

### Master the core services
A good knowledge of core services (S3, SQS, KMS, IAM) will give you a comfortable 30% correct answers for any exam, including specialties. These services appear everywhere in the AWS ecosystem.

## Conclusion

The path to all 12 AWS certifications doesn't have to break the bank. By leveraging AWS programs, using the 50% voucher system strategically, and focusing on efficient learning methods, you can achieve comprehensive AWS certification at a fraction of the typical cost.

Remember, the real value isn't just the certificates themselves - it's the systematic learning journey that makes you a better cloud architect and practitioner. The golden jacket is nice, but the knowledge you gain along the way is invaluable.

Start with the foundational certifications, use your vouchers wisely, and join AWS community programs to maximize your benefits. Your certification journey awaits!
